# About

Hey there! I'm an IT graduate (graduated in 2020) and Computer Science student at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN). I have been web developing since 2016 using PHP/Laravel or Python/Django, and data analysing with Python/pandas since 2019.

I love to write beautiful code and to feed my curiosity about many scientific discoveries and arguments. Today, my main study topics are computational intelligence subjects: data science, algorithmic bias, and statistics. I'm passionate about investigating and understanding the world through data.

In my free time, I watch as many movies and cook as many recipes as I can, while waiting for Neil Gaiman to write a new book.

May the force be with you!
