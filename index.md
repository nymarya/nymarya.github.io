# About

Hey there! I'm an IT bachelor (graduated in 2020) and Computer Science student at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN). I have been web developing since 2016 using PHP/Laravel or Python/Django, and data analysing with Python/pandas since 2019.

I love to write beautiful code, to feed my curiosity about many computer science topics, and to cultivate my crush for statistics problems. Today, my main study topics are computational intelligence subjects: data science, machine learning, and statistics.

In my free time, I watch as many movies and cook as many recipes as I can, while waiting for Neil Gaiman to write a new book.

May the force be with you!
