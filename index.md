# About

Hey there! I'm an IT student at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), with emphasis on Computer Science.

I love to write beautiful code and to feed my curiosity about many computer science topics, as well as my crush for statistics problems. Today, my main study topics are computational intelligence subjects: data science, machine learning, and deep learning.

In my free time, I watch as many movies and save as many recipes as I can, while waiting for Neil Gaiman to write a new book.

May the force be with you!
